This project was a collaborative effort undertaken as part of my Data Analyst training programme, where our team conducted web analytics for a fictional e-commerce firm. My role involved utilising SQL queries in Google BigQuery to create user funnels and analyze the conversion rates across various devices, traffic mediums, and traffic sources.

The portfolio presentation highlights a selection of the key findings we uncovered during the project, providing valuable insights into the firm's online performance and customer behaviour.
